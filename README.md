# Python-Automatic-Email-Sender
ONLY FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES

I found like this was a fun small project after I found it on youtube and gave my own spin to it, the program allows you to spam someones folder (able to send up to 100s of emails that do not get flagged as spam due to word scrambling that I implemented)
